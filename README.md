Wizard Spell (old Casio CFX RPG game)

I wrote this very simple RPG during high school on my Casio CFX-9850Ga+ and finally I want to convert it to QBasic and Petit Computer before trying to make an ehanced version on Petit computer.

My hopes is to maybe get back to programming my other game projects, and this might get me motivated again. (Or it'll just collect virtual dust again, who knows...)
